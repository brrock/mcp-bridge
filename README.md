## Overview
MCP Bridge is a robust proxy solution designed to transform STDIO-based MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers into web-accessible services. It leverages Server-Sent Events (SSE) or streamable HTTP transport, making it ideal for modern deployment scenarios where traditional STDIO communication is not feasible - e.g vercel.

## Addressing Deployment Challenges

### 🚫 **Overcoming Limitations**
-   **Serverless Environments:** STDIO communication is often incompatible with serverless platforms like Vercel. MCP Bridge eliminates this barrier.
-   **Limited Transport Options:** Moves beyond the constraints of traditional WebSocket adapters, offering broader transport compatibility.
-   **Infrastructure Restrictions:** Provides a solution for environments that do not natively support STDIO-based communication.

### ⚙️ **Enabling Flexible Transport**
-   Facilitates deployment on platforms that lack native STDIO support.
-   Offers versatile transport options, adapting to diverse environmental requirements.

## Why MCP Bridge is Essential

Do you want to self-host MCP servers for your favorite AI applications or chatbots? MCP Bridge is the perfect tool! By using MCP Bridge, optionally combined with services like Cloudflare Tunnel, you can establish a globally accessible MCP server 🌍.

### 🎯 **Key Use Cases**
-   **Self-Hosting:** Easily host MCP servers for personal or project-based AI applications.
-   **Global Accessibility:** Make local MCP servers available from anywhere.
-   **Web Application Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with web-based AI applications.
-   **Platform Compatibility:** Bypass specific platform communication limitations.

## Key Features

### 🎛️ **Management UI**
-   An intuitive web interface for effortlessly adding and managing MCP servers.
-   Visual configuration tools for streamlined setup.

### 🔗 **Connection and Config Generator**
-   Automates the generation of MCP server connection configurations.
-   Provides copy-paste-ready connection strings.
-   Supports multiple transport protocols for versatile integration.

### ⚡ **Easy Setup**
-   A streamlined installation process for quick deployment.
-   Requires minimal configuration to get started.
-   Designed for rapid deployment across various platforms.

### 🔄 **Protocol Translation**
-   Seamlessly converts STDIO-based communication to SSE/HTTP.
-   Ensures full MCP protocol compatibility throughout the translation.
-   Efficiently handles message routing and processing.

## Getting Started

To get started with MCP Bridge, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    bun i
    ```
2.  **Start Database Services (PostgreSQL & Redis):**
    ```bash
    bun docker:pg
    bun docker:redis
    ```
    *(These commands will initialize and run PostgreSQL and Redis containers via Docker.)*
3.  **Apply Database Migrations:**
    ```bash
    bun db:push
    ```
    *(This command will synchronize your database schema.)*

## Roadmap

### 🐳 **Docker Deployment**
-   **Goal:** Provide a complete containerized solution for simplified deployment.
-   **Includes:** Integrated PostgreSQL database support and Redis for session management.
-   **Benefit:** Enables one-command deployment setup, significantly reducing setup complexity.

### 🧪 **Testing Environment**
-   **Goal:** Offer a built-in environment for comprehensive MCP server testing.
-   **Includes:** Interactive debugging tools, a protocol validation and testing suite, and performance monitoring.
-   **Benefit:** Facilitates rapid development, testing, and optimization of MCP server implementations.
