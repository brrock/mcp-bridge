## Overview
MCP Bridge is a powerful proxy solution that transforms STDIO-based MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers into web-accessible services using Server-Sent Events (SSE) or streamable HTTP transport. Perfect for modern deployment scenarios where traditional STDIO communication isn't feasible.

## What This Solves

### 🚫 **Deployment Limitations**
- **Vercel deployment issues** - STDIO doesn't work in serverless environments
- **WebSocket constraints** - Limited transport options beyond what Vercel MCP adapter supports
- **Infrastructure restrictions** - Anything that isn't natively supported by existing adapters

### 🔧 **Transport Compatibility**
- Bridges the gap between STDIO and web-based protocols
- Enables deployment on platforms that don't support process-based communication
- Provides flexible transport options for different hosting environments

## Why This is Needed
